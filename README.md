## Chemshine Mortar Shells Redux
A reduced version of An Archie's [Chemshine Mortar Shells](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2143869749).  I don't use Gas Traps & Shells but wanted to fire Chemshine.


## Open the Windows Research Position Fix
The positioning overlapped with Smithing and that annoyed me.


## Watermill Research Cost
A heavily reduced version of Mlie's [reupload](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2055956298) of [XND] Watermill Tweaks.  I liked the idea of increasinhg the output but bumped it to 1450 so that 2 Watermills can power 1 Sun Lamp.  The doubling of the research cost is because it's incredible powerful when a map can support it and I don't think map-availabiltity should reduce the research cost that significantly.
